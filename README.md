Student Marks Analysis â€“ About Section (200 words)

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student exam scores to uncover performance patterns, correlations between subjects, and potential areas for academic improvement. Using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, it visualizes score distributions, identifies trends, and highlights key performance drivers.

The analysis includes descriptive statistics, subject-wise comparisons, and a correlation heatmap to understand relationships between academic subjects. Performance bands are created to categorize students and detect outliers.

Outcome & Insights:
Findings indicate strong positive correlations between mathematics and science scores, suggesting shared skill dependencies. Certain subjects exhibit higher variability, signaling inconsistency in performance across the class. The analysis also reveals that high-performing students tend to excel across multiple subjects, while struggling students often underperform consistently. These insights can guide targeted teaching interventions, resource allocation, and personalized learning strategies to improve student outcomes.
